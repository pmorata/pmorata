## You have landed on a personal experimentation repository

Im currently experimenting with some languages and tecnologies I have always had on the back of my mind and now I feel its the proper time to deep into them.

### What you will find

Projects with all kind of completeness percentage, just placeholders, prototypes, unfinished ones when I run out of interest in the reason behind the project etc.
